Yammer A/B Testing Analysis: Publisher Update
Overview
This project involves an A/B test conducted by Yammer on its core feature, the "publisher" module, where users compose messages. The goal was to assess the redesigned version of the publisher and its impact on user engagement, with a particular focus on existing users. The analysis examines multiple engagement metrics to understand user behavior changes and validate the initial observation of a higher message posting rate in the treatment group.

Period: June 1 to June 30
Groups:
Control Group: Users who interacted with the old publisher version.
Treatment Group: Users who interacted with the new publisher version.

Data Sources
The analysis uses data from:

Yammer Experiments: Details on experiment groups, user IDs, and timestamps.
Yammer Users: Contains user profiles, including activation dates to help differentiate new and existing users.
Yammer Events: Logs various user actions like logins and engagement events (e.g., message posts).
